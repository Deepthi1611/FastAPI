# sessionmaker is a factory for creating sessions. A session is used to interact with the database and perform operations like querying, inserting, and updating records.
# autocommit=False: This disables automatic committing of transactions. You will need to manually commit any changes to the database.
# autoflush=False: This prevents automatic flushing of the session, meaning changes wonâ€™t be written to the database unless explicitly told to.
# bind=engine: This binds the session to the engine so it knows which database connection to use.

# declarative_base() is a factory function that returns a base class.
# You will use this Base class as the parent class for all your ORM models. These ORM models will represent your database tables in Python.
# Any class that inherits from Base will automatically be linked to the PostgreSQL database, and SQLAlchemy will map it to the corresponding table.
